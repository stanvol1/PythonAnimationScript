# PythonAnimationScript
Quick animation script to allow you to animate a spritesheet in pygame quickly.
Stolen partly from a youtube tutorial for pygame. The Mp4 saving thing that I'm adding is made by me.
# How to use
### 1: Go into assets and place your spritesheet. Rename it to anim.png (I may change this later)
### 2: Open main.py (must have python interpreter installed on pc) and follow the instructions on screen. You may also need pygame installed, which can be installed through pip install pygame.
### 3: In theory, in the future, it will save as an mp4 file.
# Dependencies
### FFMPEG is needed for it to work. On windows, ffmpeg can be installed through the official website. On linux, it can be installed through the terminal command sudo apt install ffmpeg.
### The Python interpreter is also needed for the project to run. Go to python.org and download the latest version,.
### Pygame is also needed for this to run properly, as I used it for the graphics (sorry). To install pygame, run pip install pygame in the terminal AFTER having installed python.
