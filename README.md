# PythonAnimationScript
Quick animation script to allow you to animate a spritesheet in pygame quickly.
Stolen partly from a youtube tutorial for pygame. The Mp4 saving thing that I'm adding is made by me.
# How to use
### 1: Go into assets and place your spritesheet. Rename it to anim.png (I may change this later)
### 2: Open main.py (must have python interpreter installed on pc) and follow the instructions on screen. You may also need pygame installed, which can be installed through pip install pygame.
### 3: In theory, in the future, it will save as an mp4 file.
